# Data Structures and Algorithms with Kunal Kushwah

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This repository contains the code examples and exercises I have written while learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) from Kunal Kushwah's courses on YouTube. The goal is to provide a comprehensive collection of DSA implementations and practice problems to enhance understanding and proficiency in this essential area of computer science.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The primary programming language used for all implementations.
- **IntelliJ IDEA**: Recommended IDE for Java development.
- **Git**: Version control system for tracking changes and collaborating.

## Installation

To use the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dsa-with-kunal-kushwah.git
    cd dsa-with-kunal-kushwah
    ```

2. **Open in your preferred IDE**:
    - Open the project folder in IntelliJ IDEA or any other Java IDE.

3. **Compile and run the code**:
    - Each Java file contains a `main` method. You can run the files individually to see the output.

## Usage

This repository can be used as a reference or a study guide. Feel free to explore the code, run the examples, and modify them to enhance your understanding. Each file is self-contained with comments explaining the logic.

## Contributing
